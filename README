pypdfcrop is a small program to [auto-]crop PDF files, similar in purpose
to the 'pdfcrop' utility. This tool appends updated page layouts to the
PDF file instead of re-rendering it entirely, which preserves more
document metadata.  In particular, 'pdfcrop' drops document outlines,
while this utility preserves them.

Requires GhostScript, unless bounding boxes are specified manually. Also
requires the pyPdf library.

NEWS:

2012-05-25

Added support for cropping only from the top and bottom or the left
and right sides of each page. In this way page width or page height
can be conserved. (MHG)

2010-08-10

Added support for encrypted PDFs (including those encrypted with a blank
password). Also added even/odd alternating margins, to leave padding when
printing the resulting document for binding.


2010-08-07

Initial release. Although it's worked like a charm on every PDF
I've tried it on, GhostScript complains about the resulting files. If it
messes your PDFs up, just fire up a hex editor and delete everything after
the second-to-last '%%EOF'.

Also there's something weird about documents with rotated pages, although
I think it relates to the way GhostScript is calculating the bounding
boxes in those cases.
